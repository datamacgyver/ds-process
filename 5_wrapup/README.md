# Wrap Up Session

This is basically a retro with a bit more depth as there may be elements we want 
to create new projects/tools out of. 

* Was the project a success? Why?
* What went Well/badly? What should we do next time?
* Are there any practices, functions or code that we can reuse or generalise?
    * Where should they live, how can we document/share them?
* Based on our learnings, are there any new products or improvemetns to the output we can put on the backlog for us or product? 
    * Basically, where could these data take us next? and where could this product take us next?
