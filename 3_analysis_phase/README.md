# Analysis Phase

*This process is iterative build, test, review, repeat. As such, each stage should
be checked against KPIs and requirements to assess if it's good enough.* 

^---- That. I will place it at the start of several steps here as well. It's important
to be agile and keep the client posted of progress!

## Stages
1. [Define Any Tooling Needs](0_define_model_and_tooling.md) - Do we need to request any tooling?
2. [Establish KPIs](1_establish_KPI_checks.md) - How will we measure success? Set it up!
3. [Build](2_build.md) - Make what you need, testing against KPIs. 
4. [Review](3_review.md) - Did it work? Why? You may need to refer to [Questions to Ask](questions_to_ask_analysis.md)
*Iterate as appropriate, making sure to make use of [check-in meetings](checkin_meetings.md) with the client*

## Expected Artefacts (Confluence or Code)
* Meeting agendas, notes and actions - document(s)  
* Summary of each point in stage 2 - slides/notebook/document  
    * Can be used for Internal review
    * Simplified version for External review
* Code/output that can be versioned then shared and/or productionised.
* Data and other outputs should also be stored in the shared drive.
