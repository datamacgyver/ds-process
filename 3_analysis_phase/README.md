# Analysis Phase

*This process is iterative build, test, review, repeat. As such, each stage should
be checked against KPIs and requirements to assess if it's good enough.* 

^---- That. I will place it at the start of several steps here as well. It's important
to be agile and keep the client posted of progress!

## Stages
1. [Define Any Tooling Needs](0_define_model_and_tooling.md) - Do we need to request any tooling?
2. [Establish KPIs](1_establish_KPI_checks.md) - How will we measure success? Set it up!
3. [Build](2_build.md) - Make what you need, testing against KPIs. 
4. [Review](3_review.md) - Did it work? Why? You may need to refer to [Questions to Ask](questions_to_ask_analysis.md)
*Iterate as appropriate, making sure to make use of [check-in meetings](checkin_meetings.md) with the client*

## A Note on Repeatability
Try to imagine you in a year's time. If I asked you to repeat your analyses and 
get the exact same KPI results you should be able to do this trivially (like, 
find the code, open it and hit run). As such, you should be able to find the code, 
original data and validation metrics easily. To do this you need to make use of the 
shared folder, confluence and git in equal measure.  

## Expected Artefacts
* Meeting agendas, notes and actions - document(s) on XXXX  
* Summary of each point in stage 2 - slides/notebook/document on XXXX
    * Can be used for Internal review
    * Simplified version for External review
* Code/output that can be versioned then shared and/or productionised.
* Data and other outputs should also be stored in the shared drive.
