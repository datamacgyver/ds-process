# Build Your Outputs

*This process is iterative build, test, review, repeat. As such, each stage should
be checked against KPIs and requirements to assess if it's good enough.* 

Start building and testing! Accepting that:
* Failure can occur, you can restart, try different solutions or reframe the 
problem
* It can be easy to go from 50% to 70% accuracy but impossible to go from 
70%-90%
