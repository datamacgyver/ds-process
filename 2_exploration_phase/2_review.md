# Review Stage
As with the initialisation work, there is an internal check then an external one
but this should not be the team's only contact with the project. They have knowledge, 
use it. 

You may find it handy to refer to the [Questions to Ask](questions_to_ask.md) 
document while planning this, just remember you don't need all of it!

## Exploration review 
A rough agenda would be:

* Reminder: Project scope and product need to frame discussion
* Reminder: Initial guidelines, requirements and KPIs
* Assumptions made: data format, availability, acceptable mistakes and 
common product use patterns
* Data used, and how it was explored. Will be needed to justify both some 
assumptions and the choice of approach
* List of possible approaches/solutions arrived at, detailing the pros and 
cons of each (including assumptions)
    * Selected approach going forward & justifications
* Why may we have to use a different solution?

Finally, this needs to be stated/thought about:
> Is this project a goer? If not, do we need to re-frame or drop it? 

## External Review		
High level summary of the outcomes of the above:
* What will we be building?
* What are our assumptions? 
* What will the outputs look like? 

In all cases, make sure this is aligned to the business case and that the client
understands/agrees that this is the case. As with initialisation, it needs to be 
explicit how the solution and KPIs fulfill their business need.
