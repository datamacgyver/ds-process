# Exploration Phase

There is a lot of documentation to this section as it **CAN** have many facets
or be quite involved. Similarly, it may be relatively quick if we know we want 
a simple model that does a basic thing that hasn't been done before. As with 
all parts of this process *read it, decide what you need <u>and why</u>, press on*.

This phase of the process is also iterative, there may be multiple places where 
you go back to the client, the data or the drawing board! This is natural but 
make sure to keep your iterations contained to weeks at most and make sure you 
have regular review sessions with the team and catch-ups with the client. 

## What we are trying to accomplish?
This is the phase where we get down and dirty with the data. The primary
thing to remember is that you are not here to explain or observe every pattern
or trend. By all means, keep notes of things you've observed and potential 
future projects or improvements but we need to keep this focused. If you see 
something weird or interesting then by all means dig for a bit but **timebox 
yourself and keep one eye on your goals.**

This is also the phase where we get down and dirty with the literature (just 
make sure the data don't find out!). As above, be mindful of the depth to 
which you dig: if you will need to implement the model from base principles then 
you need to know them; if you want to be the team expert in this then you need to 
know the minutae; but if you need to build an SK Learn model and deploy it then (in 
theory) you really just need to understand the strengths, weaknesses and
assumptions in play.
