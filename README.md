# Data Science Process

This repo summarises the stages in the Data Science Project Process. It is 
meant to be a living set of documents we can update as we go along (hence the 
use of Git!). **For editing, please use Pycharm or similar.** It helps you 
maintain links and markdown form.

## No Best Practice!
Note that these guides only form as a guide to *good* practice. If you feel something
doesn't fit your project then don't use it, but be sure you are consciously making 
that decision for good reasons. Also chat with others, it may be we need to change 
something!

## The Process
ADD AN IMAGE
This is the outline process defined in 2020 (0 BC, Before Covid), again it is a 
suggestion and it does not precisely mirror the documents and stages you will 
find in this repo. It does help share the gist of what we are trying to get at 
though. 

## Contents
At this root level you will find one folder for each phase. Each folder will contain a 
root readme (like this) giving you further details on the whats and the whys. 

* [**Initialisation:**](1_initialisation_phase) Requirements gathering and data access.
* [**Exploration:**](2_exploration_phase) Checking the data and the literature.
* [**Analysis:**](3_analysis_phase)  Modelling, building, etc. 
* [**Deliverables:**](4_deliverables_phase) Handing off artefacts, documentation and maintenance procedures. 
* [**Wrapup:**](5_wrapup) Summarising and learning from the project (success or failure). A retro, basically. 


## TODOs
* Q: Confluence or shared drive for project docs? 
* Lock down main branch so we need to do pull requests  
* Add an image of the process  
* Add some references/links to what I've used  
* Where should all this live? 
* Generalise the points - we don't just build models!
