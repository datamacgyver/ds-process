# Objectives Alignment

This stage has two parts: the internal review (does this all make sense), and
the external review (is it what was asked for).

# Internal Review
Lead analyst presents their work on the [Digestion Phase](./2_brief_digestion.md),
specifically highlighting the scope and how the KPIs align to this. Remember, this 
isn't doing all the things, it's working out which things!

This is also an opportunity to collect ideas from the floor as to possible approaches, 
additions, side projects, past work and future product ideas. 

# External Review
As above but with a much greater focus on scope and KPIs. Remember: Most people don't care 
how you did it. 

The primary goal is to make sure we are solving the right problem in the right way in a form
that can be delivered! As such, the client needs to be clearly aware of how the KPIs fufull 
that need.
