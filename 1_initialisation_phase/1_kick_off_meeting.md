# Kick-off meeting

This initial meeting with the client is intended to define the problem 
statements, along with any initial KPIs. You also need to establish what 
data are available and *start the process of getting access*. This can 
take ages so get it going, the same is true for any documentation, repos, 
etc that may be needed! 

## Problem Statements or KPIs?
This is probably your primary objective in terms of defining the project. 
Something like: 
> As a salesperson, I want to be able to quickly identify which of my customers have decreasing 
> spend in crop Protection so I can increase my total sales.

It is also possible you will be able to get hard KPIs out of this meeting, 
don't worry if not, that is a job for another time. If you can then you 
are looking for something like:  
 
> As a salesperson, want to be able to detect 70% of my customers at risk of churn, 
> with a false positive rate below 20%. 

## Example Questions List
Non-exhaustive, add/remove as appropriate! It may be that you are required to fill 
these in yourself as part of brief digestion. If so, you will then need to validate 
with the client. 

#### Who are we meeting? Department, role, etc?
Is there anyone else who may need to be involved? Either from a direct 
tech/design/requirements standpoint or strategy/sales? It may be that 
some only want later (or earlier) involvement.
 
#### What are the objectives we are trying to achieve? 
See "Problem Statements or KPIs", above. 

#### If known, what value does achieving these provide? 
e.g. reduction in lost sales, exploratory or product discussions may not 
know this in great detail.

#### If known, what are the requirements for a deliverable? 
Basically, what/where would this live? Think of things like artefacts, deployment, 
testing, speed, accuracy (or similar), documentation, batch/RT, target architecture.

#### Who will be responsible for signing off/implementing the deliverable? 
Have we spoken to them? Can we? How will they be involved? 

#### Is any ongoing support required after delivery?
For example, monitoring a model for slippage.

#### What are the expected timelines for delivery and updates?
How soon is it needed? Whatâ€™s the urgency? How often do you want to be updated? 

#### What data are available and what hoops exist to access it? Who created/owns it? 
To include expected timelines for access and contacts.

#### What (if any) previous work has been done on this? By whom? Where does it live? 
Can we read/talk/explore this?
