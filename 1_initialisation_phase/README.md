# Initialisation

The purpose of this phase is not to work out the exact methodology for the work, 
it is to work out what the requirements and KPIs are for it. As such, you may be 
required to do some data exploration but don't go nuts (that's the next bit).

At a guess, this phase should last between one and two weeks, depending on the project. 

## Stages
1. [Kick-off Meeting](1_kick_off_meeting.md) - Inital scoping with the client/stakeholder.
2. [Brief Digestion](2_brief_digestion.md) - Lead analyst creates requirements/scope.
3. [Objectives Alignment](3_objectives_alignment.md) - Internal and external reveiw of stage 2.

## Expected Artefacts
* Meeting agendas, notes and actions - document(s) on XXXX  
* Summary of each point in stage 2 - slides/notebook/document on XXXX
    * Can be used for Internal review
    * Simplified version for External review
