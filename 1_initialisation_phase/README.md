# Initialisation

The purpose of this phase is not to work out the exact methodology for the work, 
it is to work out what the requirements and KPIs are for it. As such, you may be 
required to do some data exploration but don't go nuts (that's the next bit).

At a guess, this phase should last between one and two weeks, depending on the project. 
Sometimes you will find a client that just wants to play, in which case this can be 
mainly internal exercise, but it should remain an exercise!

## How Long? 
Barring re-writes this should not take more than 1-2 weeks. 

## Stages
1. [Kick-off Meeting](1_kick_off_meeting.md) - Initial scoping with the client/stakeholder.
2. [Brief Digestion](2_brief_digestion.md) - Lead analyst creates requirements/scope.
3. [Objectives Alignment](3_objectives_alignment.md) - Internal and external reveiw of stage 2.

## Expected Artefacts (Confluence or Code)
* Meeting agendas, notes and actions - document(s)  
* Summary of each point in stage 2 - slides/notebook/document  
    * Can be used for Internal review
    * Simplified version for External review
