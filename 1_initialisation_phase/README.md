# Initialisation

The purpose of this phase is not to work out the exact methodology for the work, 
it is to work out what the requirements and KPIs are for it. As such, you may be 
required to do some data exploration but don't go nuts (that's the next bit).

At a guess, this phase should last between one and two weeks, depending on the project.
